                <p>Information tracking is how companies will store information about its users, like you, and what they've searched, viewed, and clicked on. Using all of the information that a company itself and any partnered companies have about its users, a company builds profiles about who they think you are and what you might be interested in, and runs ads accordingly.</p>
                <p>This includes companies like big tech corporations like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Twitter, as well as all of the services they provide and smaller companies that they own.</p>

                <p>The tech companies that provide things like email, social media, video streaming, etc are "free," but only because they are able to make profit off of other things such as ads.</p>
                <p>Because companies profit from you staying engaged, they will try to show the content they think will change your behavior towards clicking on the ads - for anything from shopping to voting - and keep you on your device for as long as possible. That is the only way that many companies are able to offer its platforms without requiring users to pay them directly.</p>
