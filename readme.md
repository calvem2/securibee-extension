# securi-bee
 
### Project Description:
Our project consists of a Chrome extension and website that explains internet safety and security concepts to 
non-technical folks. The website will have information about what data tech companies have about users, what is done with 
that data, how that impacts users, and real world examples of poor security consequences. However, since internet safety 
information has a tendency to be all in one place and too much information all at once to be easily digestible and actionable, 
the Chrome extension will share non-invasive pop-ups with specific information based on the website the user is on. The extension
also provides a tool for checking password strength that helps users implement the password security tips they've learned from our website.

## Implementation
As mentioned above, securi-bee consists of a website and Chrome extension. The website allows users to explore various security concepts. Users can read about these concepts, learn why they care, explore relevant, real-world stories, and get tools and tips related to the concept. Users can also learn how to access the securi-bee extension where they can then utilize its information tracking and password security tools. The website is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is currently hosted on github. The Chrome extension is implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Google’s Chrome Extension API. The extension is available for download on github. Once downloaded, the extension can be added to Google Chrome for use.
