# securi-bee
 
### Project Description:
Our project consists of a Chrome extension and website that explains internet safety and security concepts to 
non-technical folks. The website will have information about what data tech companies have about users, what is done with 
that data, how that impacts users, and real world examples of poor security consequences. However, since internet safety 
information has a tendency to be all in one place and too much information all at once to be easily digestible and actionable, 
the Chrome extension will share non-invasive pop-ups with specific suggestions based on the website the user is on. 

### To Run the Extension
To access the securi-bee Google Chrome Extension, you can complete the following steps:

1. Download Google Chrome if you don’t already have it, and open the browser

3. Clone our GitLab repo or download zip and unzip 
4. Click "Load unpacked" button and navigate to the folder you downloaded from GitLab
5. Select the inner folder called “extension”
6. Select the Chrome Extensions puzzle piece icon, find securi-bee, and click on the thumbtack icon to pin the extension to your Chrome browser view
